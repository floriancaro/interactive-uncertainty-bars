# An Interactive Bar Chart Visualization Inspired by Ferreira et al. (2014)

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for a rough first attempt to implement an interactive visualization of uncertainty in random sample estimates inspired by the paper Ferreira, N., Fisher, D., & Konig, A. C. (2014, April), "Sample-oriented task-driven visualizations: allowing users to make better, more confident decisions."
